# CLAUDE.md — qalam

## What this project is

Personal Arabic learning tool — texts, vocabulary, roots, SRS training, annotations, interlinear glosses. Single user (Toni).

## Repo layout

```
backend/      Kotlin + Ktor
frontend/     SvelteKit (bootstrapped, M2 complete)
docs/         Source of truth for design decisions, architecture rules, plans and working rules
justfile      dev commands: just up / just db / just dev-backend / just dev-frontend / just test
docker-compose.yml  full dev stack (postgres, backend, frontend)
```

## Stack (locked — don't deviate without asking)

## Architecture rules

**Backend** — Clean/Onion, deps inward only:
- Routes → Services → Repositories (interfaces) → Exposed/DB
- Domain has zero framework deps
- Koin for DI, constructor injection only, no `KoinComponent` sprinkled everywhere
- Sealed classes for domain errors, `Either<DomainError, A>` across service boundaries
- No throwing across service boundaries

**Frontend** — thin routes, component stores, no direct API calls from components:
- Components call stores or accept props
- Stores hold server state (svelte-query), not UI state
- UI state (modals, hover, selection) lives in the component that owns it

**Frontend CSS** — global-first, scoped as last resort:
- Before adding a scoped `<style>` rule, check `frontend/src/styles/` — use the existing global class if one fits
- `frontend/src/app.css` is the style import manifest and source of truth for import order
- Global files are split by concern: `layout.css` (app shell and page layouts), `components.css` (shared component primitives), `utilities.css` (layout helpers), feature partials like `word.css`, `root.css`, `text.css`, `lists.css`, `home.css`, `forms.css`, `training.css`, `annotations.css`, `editors.css`, `ai.css`, `error.css`, plus `semantic.css`, `animations.css`, `tokens.css`, `base.css`, `arabic.css`
- Do not grow `layout.css` into a catch-all again; new shared rules go into the narrowest existing partial that fits, or a new partial if the concern is genuinely new
- Avoid duplicate names across feature families; class names should stay semantic within their slice (`root-*`, `word-*`, `fc-*`, `annotation-*`, etc.)
- Scoped styles are for component-unique structure only (e.g. a specific grid layout not shared anywhere)
- App is light-mode only — never add `.dark` variants

**API**:
- All under `/api/v1/`
- OpenAPI generated at startup → `/api/v1/openapi.json` + `/api/v1/swagger-ui`
- Pagination: `page` + `size`, response: `{ items, total, page, size }`
- Error envelope: `{ error, code }`
- Frontend types generated via `pnpm generate:types` from the spec — never hand-write types

## Database rules

- Flyway SQL migrations only — naming: `V001__create_extensions.sql`
- UUID PKs generated in application code
- Enums as VARCHAR + CHECK constraints (not PG ENUM types)
- All FK columns have explicit `ON DELETE`; all FK/filter columns indexed
- No auto-DDL ever

## Non-negotiables

1. No native image — `./gradlew test` under 2 min / `./gradlew check` under 5 min is the target
2. Every feature reachable via `curl`
3. AI features degrade gracefully to 503 `AI_NOT_CONFIGURED` without `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
4. No `any` in TypeScript, as few nullable values as possible in Kotlin — enforced by linters and code review
5. `doppler run -- just up` starts the full Docker stack; local backend dev uses `just dev-backend`
6. Frontend checks must always pass before committing any `.svelte` or CSS file:
   - `just lint-frontend` — Biome lint (zero errors, zero warnings)
   - `just format-frontend` — Biome format (run, stage any auto-fixes, re-lint)
   - `just check-frontend` — svelte-check type safety (zero errors, zero warnings)
7. the `superpowers` skill MUST be used and loaded in every new session
8. the `caveman ultra` skill MUST be used and loaded in every new session

## Working style with Tony

- One task at a time, stop and share after each logical unit, allow the user to give feedback, correct and implement himself
- Sketch approach in words before writing real code for non-trivial things
- Pause at design forks: present options briefly, let Tony choose
- Update `docs/` when behaviour/API/data model changes — proactively, not when asked
- **Any change to a backend endpoint (new param, changed response, new route) MUST update `backend/src/main/resources/openapi/documentation.yaml` in the same step — it is the source of truth for frontend types**
- Tony is an experienced developer — don't over-explain, don't pad responses, and co-operate with him, do not replace him
